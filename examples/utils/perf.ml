  {|perf -r <min time> <command>

     Determine the number of reps needed for <command> to take at least
     about <min time> (wall-clock time, in seconds; fractional value
     accepted).  The <command> should take time roughly proportional to
     the (integral) numerical value of the environment variable NUM_REPS.

perf -m <reps file> <n> <command>

     Take <n> measurements of the execution time (wall-clock time) of
     <command> with NUM_REPS set to the value recorded in <reps file>.
     <reps file> should contain the output of a previous run of perf -r.|}
