Benchmarking notes
==================

* Ensure that Sundials is built with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, otherwise 
  it is compiled without any optimisations.

* Official benchmarks should be built with 
    make perf.opt.log GC_AT_END=1 PERF_DATA_POINTS=10

  The ‘unsafe’ data (i.e., no array bounds checks, etc.) is generated by 
  rebuilding Sundials/ML with `--unsafe`.

Analysis/Debugging
==================

To run everything with valgrind:
```
make RUN_WITH_VALGRIND=1 tests.opt.log
```

Or just a single example:
```
GC_EACH_REP=1 GC_AT_END=1 valgrind --leak-check=full \
  ./ark_heat1D_adapt.opt > /dev/null
```

To run a program under valgrind so that gdb can attach to it:
```
GC_AT_END=1 valgrind --leak-check=full --vgdb=full \
  --vgdb-error=0 ./ark_heat1D_adapt.opt > /dev/null
```

Triggering leak checks from gdb + valgrind:
```
# Assume gdb is attached to a process supervised by valgrind.
monitor leak_check full reachable any  # Check leaks.
monitor block_list <loss record ID(s)> # Get details of the leak.
```

The examples can be compiled to use the OCaml runtime with debugging 
features (like assertions) enabled.
```
make COMPILE_WITH_RUNTIME_DEBUG=1
```

Profiling
=========

Performance differences can be analyzed with 
[valgrind](http://valgrind.org), 
[kcachegrind](https://kcachegrind.github.io), or Linux's `perf stat`.

Using `kcachegrind`:
```
NUM_REPS=20000 valgrind --tool=callgrind ./cvAnalytic_mels >/dev/null
kcachegrind callgrind.out.<pid>
```

Memory Leaks
============

To detect memory leaks, run GCs in verbose mode and watch whether the heap 
size grows:
```
OCAMLRUNPARAM=v=0x404 ...
```

For more detailed analysis of heap usage use 
[memtrace](https://blog.janestreet.com/finding-memory-leaks-with-memtrace/).

```
opam install memtrace memtrace_viewer
```

Add the following line to the program under test:
```
let _ = Memtrace.trace_if_requested ()
```

Compile it with these additional arguments:
```
-thread -I $(opam var lib)/memtrace ... unix.cmxa threads.cmxa memtrace.cmxa...
```

And run it with
```
NUM_REPS=20000 MEMTRACE=trace.ctf ./cvAnalytic_mels.opt  > /dev/null
```
