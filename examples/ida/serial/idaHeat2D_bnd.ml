 * Example problem for IDA: 2D heat equation, serial, banded.
 *
 * This example solves a discretized 2D heat equation problem.
 * This version uses the band solver IDABand, and IDACalcIC.
 *
 * The DAE system solved is a spatial discretization of the PDE
 *          du/dt = d^2u/dx^2 + d^2u/dy^2
 * on the unit square. The boundary condition is u = 0 on all edges.
 * Initial conditions are given by u = 16 x (1 - x) y (1 - y).
 * The PDE is treated with central differences on a uniform M x M
 * grid. The values of u at the interior points satisfy ODEs, and
 * equations u = 0 at the boundaries are appended, to form a DAE
 * system of size N = M^2. Here M = 10.
 *
 * The system is solved with IDA using the banded linear system
 * solver, half-bandwidths equal to M, and default
 * difference-quotient Jacobian. For purposes of illustration,
 * IDACalcIC is called to compute correct values at the boundary,
 * given incorrect values as input initial guesses. The constraints
 * u >= 0 are posed for all components. Output is taken at
 * t = 0, .01, .02, .04, ..., 10.24. (Output at t = 0 is for
 * IDACalcIC cost statistics only.)
