(* A pendulum attached to a rigid rod banging against a wall, modeled by a DAE
   in Cartesian coordinates.  The wall extends 30 degrees to the left of the
   plumb line extending from the pivot.

      .
     //\          // is the wall, \ is the rod, . is the pivot, o is a mass.
    //  \
   //    o

   The Cartesian-coordinate DAE governing this system is

     x'' = p x
     y'' = p y - g
     x^2 + y^2 = r^2

   where g is the gravitational acceleration, r is the length of the rod, x,y
   is the position of the mass, and p is the mass' (signed) acceleration due to
   the rod pulling on the mass.  The rod's pull is parallel to the direction of
   the rod, so it is a scalar multiple of (x,y), i.e. (p x, p y) where p is a
   scalar variable.

   IDA needs the system to be put into the form F(t,X,X') = 0, so we introduce
   auxiliary variables vx and vy, representing the mass' velocity.

     vx - x'         = 0
     vy - y'         = 0
     vx' - p x       = 0
     vy' - p y + g   = 0
     x^2 + y^2 - r^2 = 0

   This is a system with five unknowns (x,y,vx,vy,p) and five equations, so it
   is properly constrained (i.e. neither over- nor under-constrained).

   p is an algebraic variable (its derivative p' does not appear), while all
   other variables are differential (their derivatives appear in the
   equations).

   The system as given above has index 3.  By differentiating the last
   constraint we can lower the index.

     index 2:
         vx - x'         = 0
         vy - y'         = 0
         vx' - p x       = 0
         vy' - p y + g   = 0
         x vx + y vy     = 0

     index 1:
         vx - x'         = 0
         vy - y'         = 0
         vx' - p x       = 0
         vy' - p y + g   = 0
         x vx' + y vy' + vx^2 + vy^2 = 0

   Further variations can be obtained by replacing some occurrences of vx in
   the last constraint equation with x' (but not occurrences of vx' with x'',
   because that would make the system second-order again) and replacing vy by
   y'.  Conceptually, one would expect that this has no effect on the solution,
   but it seems to affect the precision of the solution and some formulations
   can cause convergence failures.

   There are total of 14 different formulations for the last constraint, which
   can be switched from the command line.  A constructor of the constraint_form
   type showing the desired formula should be given varbatim as the argument to
   the -constraint commandline option.

   This file supplies analytically derived Jacobian function and initial
   condition calculator.  The analytical Jacobian function is more precise than
   the fallback implementation provided by IDA, while the initial condition
   calculator is precise and never fails whereas IDA's initial condition
   calculator fails depending on the format of the constraint formula.  These
   functions are disabled by default and are activated through -analytical-jac
   and -analytical-ic, respectively.
